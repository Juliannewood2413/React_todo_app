# To Do App

### This project allows the user to keep track of tasks by adding them on this easy to use list. They can add as many items as they wish and they will be saved to local storage. Items are crossed off the list when complete, and deleted with the click of a button. Users can also filter the list to see either tasks that have been completed, tasks that are remaining, or view all.
